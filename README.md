This repository contains the source code and configuration files for my personal website, built using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). You can view the live demo at [saeedsabet.com](https://saeedsabet.com).

## Getting Started

### Running the Website Locally

You can preview the website locally by running the following command:

Then, open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to see the website live.

### Building the Static Site

To build the static version of your website, use:

```bash

```

This will generate a `site/` directory containing all the files for your website.

### Customizing the Website

- To edit the content, modify the markdown files in the `docs/` folder.
- You can customize the theme and other options by editing the `mkdocs.yml` configuration file.

### Deployment

```bash
mkdocs gh-deploy
```

This will automatically push the `site/` folder to a `gh-pages` branch on your repository.
